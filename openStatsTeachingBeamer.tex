\begin{block}{The basics}
\begin{itemize}
        \item founded in 2009 by David Diez and Chris Barr
        \item goal: create a free and open-source introductory textbook

\begin{frame}{Consequences of OpenIntro being Open}
\begin{block}{Benefits}
\begin{itemize}
\item No barriers to access (financial, geographic)
\item Many eyes for errata, rapid revision
\item Easy to keep timely
\item Flexible source that can be modified for student's needs
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Challenges}
\begin{itemize}
\item Requires a different business model
\item Adoption decision is made by professors, not students
\end{itemize}

\begin{frame}{What is statsTeachR.org?}

\begin{block}{The basics}
\begin{itemize}
        \item a new, open-access, online repository with modular lesson plans
        \item materials targeted at undergraduates and graduates 
        \item topics: stats, biostats, statistical computing with R
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Modules}
\begin{itemize}
        \item each curricular ``module'' focuses on teaching a particular statistical subject or concept
        \item can be browsed \`a la carte

\begin{frame}{For discussion . . .}

 \begin{quote}
\footnotesize
...the problem with open source textbooks, software, videos and other materials is that they ultimately declare to students, to administrators and to the public that faculty intellectual creations have no market value, and hence, are worthless.  When all information wants to be free, who will employ information producers, be it be lecturers, expositors, musicians, architects, poets?
\end{quote}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

\begin{frame}{Discussion Questions}

\begin{itemize}
        \item where does the time/money/person-hours come from to generate these resources?
        \item how to incentivize these kinds of contributions appropriately?
        \item how to control quality of resources?
\end{itemize}
